To execute, download the latest version together with the inputs folder.
(It is important due to the location of the dataset,
if only downloading the .ipynb make sure that the dataset is in a folder called inputs in the same directory as the .ipynb).

Then just run the whole .ipynb and you will be able to observe our results.
(You will need to introduce some inputs in a couple of examples, but it will be clearly indicated).

Thanks,
Jordi, Pau and Paula
