To execute, download the whole repository.
(It is important due to the location of the dataset,
if only downloading the .ipynb make sure that the dataset is in a folder called inputs in the same directory as the .ipynb).

Then just run the whole .ipynb and you will be able to observe our results.

Thanks,
