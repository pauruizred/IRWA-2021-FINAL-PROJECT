Download the repository. In the "Previous Deliveries" folder you will only find the deliverables for the other parts.
The last part is "search-engine-web-app-main".
Get that folder and create the necessary virtual environment (as you have shown us to do).
Then execute the web_app.py document.
The index will be built (it may take a while) and then you will only need to enter the specified ip on your browser to start trying our system.

Thanks,
Jordi, Pau and Paula
